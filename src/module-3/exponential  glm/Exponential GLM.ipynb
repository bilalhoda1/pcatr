    "\n",
    "Here, b3 is a regression coefficient, and $X_1X_2$ is the interaction. The interaction between $X_1$ and $X_2$ is called a two-way interaction, because it is the interaction between two independent variables. Higher-order interactions are possible, as illustrated by the three-way interaction in the following equation:\n",

    "We first fitted a glm with all of the explanatory variables included. Then we used the dredge function to make models of all possible combinations of those features. Since we have 6 features then all possible combinations will be $2^6$ = 64 because there are two possibilities for each feature either it could be in the model or either it cannot. We have different choices of link function so we try log link and inverse link function and choose the model which fits better."

    "The nagelkerke( ) function provides three types of Pseudo R-squared value (McFadden, Cox and Snell, and Cragg and Uhler) and Likelihood ratio test results. The McFadden Pseudo R-squared value is the commonly reported metric for binary logistic regression model fit. The table result showed that the McFadden Pseudo R-squared value is 9.26211e-06, which indicates the model has no predictive ability, although the likelihood value for the current model will be (it is always) larger than the likelihood of the null model, it will not be much greater. Therefore $R^{2}_{\\text{McFadden}}$ will be close to zero, as we would hope.[3,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the table provides a Likelihood ratio test. Likelihood Ratio test (often termed as LR test) is a goodness of fit test used to compare between two models; the null model and the final model. The null hypothesis is that the smaller model is the “best” model; It is rejected when the test statistic is large. In other words, if the null hypothesis is rejected, then the larger model is a significant improvement over the smaller one. The test revealed that the Log-Likelihood difference between intercept only model (null model) and model fitted with all independent variables is -18970 and p-value 0 which shows the improvement is significant as (p-value < 0.05) and we reject the null hypothesis.[3,4]"
