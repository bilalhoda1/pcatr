# Prediction of Call Arrival Times and Rates

## 1. Purpose

In an industry which requires precise allocation of resources, scheduling mechanisms play an integral role. Accurate scheduling offers benefits and satisfaction to businesses as the business leaders can safely control their service quality as well as the finances. Examples of such businesses include food delivery (such as Food Panda, Eat Mubarak, Home Chef, etc.), ride-hailing services (such as Careem, Uber, Bykea, Siayara, etc.), call centers, etc. All these industries can revolutionize customer experiences if provided with proper analytics which in turn allow them to perform scheduling operations effectively and precisely.

In this project, we plan to solve a pre-requisite problem for scheduling human resources in a *call center industry*. In a traditional call center, under-staffing leads to effecting services whereas over-staffing generates a high financial overhead. This problem can be solved/minimized with efficient prediction mechanisms which can be used to estimate call arrival times and rates.

## 2. Background

Background knowledge in following areas is necessary to contribute to this project:
- Probability and Statistics
- Machine Learning
- Algorithms: Design and Analysis
- Data Science
- Data Structures
- Discrete Mathematics

## 3. The Problem Set

The problem set is divided into three separate modules, stated below:
- *Module 1:* _When can we expect the next call to come in?_
- *Module 2:* _Amongst well-defined possible categories, which type of call will it be?_
- *Module 3:* _Within a defined interval, how many calls can we expect from a particular category of callers?_

The problem is to devise a set of algorithms that is able to answer the above questions within a _reasonable degree of accuracy_ which will be further clarified and finalized after exhaustive literature review.
The full specifications of any answer to the above problem, therefore, requires the following elements:
- One or more metrics that allow us to objectively measure how an algorithm or strategy performs in answering the above questions
- A set of algorithms that is able to answer the above questions
- A list of data elements/inputs that are required by the algorithms

## 4. Deliverables

The project aims to solve the problem discussed in Section 3. Following is the set of deliverables we expect to share at the end of this project.
- A non-publishable Python package/library of algorithms (similar to Sci-Kit Learn, Numpy, SciPy, etc.) for the domain of scheduling algorithms
- A well-defined documentation for the above mentioned library
- A research paper
- A visualization dashboard
